# A Research on Interaction between Non-coding RNA and Protein



### Project Summary

to study the Mechanism of IncRNA-Protein pairs on Heart-failure

### Modeling Description

- using k-mer to decode the RNA & protein sequences containing both base pairs and structure information
- converting the sequences information into sparse matrix
- feature selection by RandomForest
- tuning hyperparameters for LightGBM & XGB & Catboost
- stacking ensemble
- model evaluation
